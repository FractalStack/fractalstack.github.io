                    <ul>
                        <li>This is likely due to missing or incorrect permissions. Check all the roles and policies you have attached to your identity pool, lambda function, etc.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the policies have the correct permission to access the resources. If you have a policy for GameLift attached to an identity pool, without any permissions for GameLift, well you probably need to add those permissions. This goes for any resources you’re trying to access.</li>
                        <li>If you are using a User Pool, make sure your Identity Pool has the Cognito tab under Authentication providers completed with user pool id and app client id.</li>
                        <li>If you’re allowing users access who are unauthenticated, make sure you check the “Enable access to unatuenticatded identities” in the Identity pool.</li>

                        <li>The most common error I see is an incorrect region somewhere in the code</li>
                        <li>Make sure you do a search in the baseline for us-east-1, if you are NOT using us-east-1 for GameLift or whatever else you’re working on, make sure to change it to the region you’ve deployed your services to.</li>

                        <li>I use an “isProd” flag in some of my projects, when added it readies the code to be deployed to actual AWS services and NOT local testing.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have this flag added where applicable, noted in the videos.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you have at least 1 fleet instance under the “Active Instances” header on the fleet details</li>
                        <li>You can scale the instances up or down under the Scaling tab, towards the bottom.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to set it back to 0 when not testing, or else you will be billed!</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you are reviewing all the logs.</li>
                        <li>GameLift session logs are available once a game session is terminated. If your game session is stuck open, tick down the desired instance count to 0 and wait for it to shutdown, then the logs will be available.</li>
                        <li>If you are debugging an issue, make sure you place debug logs throughout your code to help you track down the issue.</li>
                        <li>If you see logs in Unity and they seem like a wall of useless text, well, look closely, there's usually one line in there that will give us a hint at what the issue is. See the HttpErrorResponseException example below, it illustrates how one line can make the difference!</li>

                <li>

                    <p>This is a general exception that I see quite a bit as it can be thrown from
                        various AWS API calls. But for this one, I'll be focusing an example exception
                        that's thrown when calling out to a Lambda function from your Unity project. As
                        in the case when you're trying to connect to the Realtime GameLift server. It may
                        look something like this: <br />

                        <small>
                            <pre><code>
   HttpErrorResponseException: Exception of type 'Amazon.Runtime.Internal.HttpErrorResponseException' was thrown.
   Amazon.Runtime.HttpWebRequestMessage+<GetResponseAsync>d__20.MoveNext () 
   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---

                  </code></pre></small>
                    </p>

                    <p>When you click on the error you'll see a much larger stack trace that just seems
                        to repeat. However, if you look carefully, you'll see the real cause: the call
                        you made from your Unity project to the Lambda function was denied.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Usually that means there's something wrong with the permissions set in the
                            role:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make sure you have the correct Actions and Resource.</li>
                                <li>Make sure the Lambda function name is the one you're trying to access.</li>
                                <li>Double check the region.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img class="mt-3 card-img-top img-fluid" src="/assets/img/httpErrorResponseException-resolution.jpg" alt="AmazonLambdaException">
                        </li>

                        <li>If the role looks good, make sure that it's attached to the correct identity
                            Pool.</li>
                        <li>Check your Cognito Identity Pool configurations (select the pool, hit edit in
                            top right) and verify the
                            <strong>Unauthenticated role</strong> is set to the correct one.</li>
                        <li><em>If you find something else that worked, please let me know and I'll add it!</em></li>
