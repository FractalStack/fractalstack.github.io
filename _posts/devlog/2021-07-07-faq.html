               <p>This is a general exception that I see quite a bit as it can be thrown from
                  various AWS API calls. But for this one, I'll be focusing an example exception
                  that's thrown when calling out to a Lambda function from your Unity project. As
                  in the case when you're trying to connect to the Realtime GameLift server. It may
                  look something like this: <br />

                  <small><pre><code>
   HttpErrorResponseException: Exception of type 'Amazon.Runtime.Internal.HttpErrorResponseException' was thrown.
   Amazon.Runtime.HttpWebRequestMessage+<GetResponseAsync>d__20.MoveNext () 
   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---
   System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw ()
   System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess (System.Threading.Tasks.Task task)
   System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification (System.Threading.Tasks.Task task)
   System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ValidateEnd (System.Threading.Tasks.Task task)
   System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ConfiguredTaskAwaitable`1+ConfiguredTaskAwaiter[TResult].GetResult ()
   Amazon.Runtime.Internal.HttpHandler`1+<InvokeAsync>d__9`1[TRequestContent,T].MoveNext () 
   --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---
   ...
                  </code></pre></small>
               </p>

               <p>When you click on the error you'll see a much larger stack trace that just seems
                  to repeat. However, if you look carefully, you'll see the real cause: the call
                  you made from your Unity project to the Lambda function was denied.

                  <li>Usually that means there's something wrong with the permissions set in the
                     role:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Make sure you have the correct Actions and Resource.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the Lambda function name is the one you're trying to access.</li>
                        <li>Double check the region.</li>
                     </ul>

                  </li>

                  <li>If the role looks good, make sure that it's attached to the correct identity
                     Pool.</li>
                  <li>Check your Cognito Identity Pool configurations (select the pool, hit edit in
                     top right) and verify the
                     <strong>Unauthenticated role</strong> is set to the correct one.</li>

            </li>
