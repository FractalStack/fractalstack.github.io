         <p>A walkthrough that shows how to make your own multiplayer game with player movement
            synchronization across clients.
            Uses AWS API Gateway, Lambda, & DynamoDb, and Unity as a game client. I wanted to do
            this without using GameLift as it is a much cheaper option, if the functionality works
            for your project.
         </p>
         <p>Player movements will be sent to the server which in turn broadcasts those movements to
            the other player-clients, rendering the opponent’s movement.
            This is a home grown solution using WebSockets to communicate between the Unity clients
            and AWS API Gateway/Lambda.
         </p>
         <p>Please note that this is NOT a production-ready implementation, but if you’re an indie
            dev that just wants to get something up and running without having to worry about high
            costs, then this may be a good starting point. This was designed to be for realtime
            movements but it can also be refactored to use in a turn based game.
         </p>
