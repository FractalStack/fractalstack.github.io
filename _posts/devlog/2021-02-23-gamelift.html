         <h1 class="display-1 mt-5">What is GameLift?</h1>
         <p>AWS GameLift is a service tailored to run your game’s backend servers. Before diving
            too deep into any new service, it is important to understand your project’s
            requirements. If you have a single player game or if you’re looking to host your game
            client (so not the server part), GameLift is not for you.</p>
         <p class="lead pl-2 primary-left-border">As a side note, if you’d still like to use AWS
            Services in your project, regardless if it is multiplayer or not, you can install the
            .NET SDKs into your project and access all of their service APIs like S3, DynamoDb,
            Lambda, CloudWatch, etc.
         </p>
         <p>Some basic definitions:</p>
         <p><strong>Game Client</strong> this is the part that the player downloads and plays the
            game on, Unity game client. Most of us use Steam as a way to download the game clients
            when purchasing a
            new game.</p>
         <p><strong>Game Server</strong> this is the backend that the Game Client sends messages
            to. It can be comprised of multiple services like authentication, matchmaking, game
            simulation, session management, and storing data, etc. GameLift is an attempt to
            streamline these services.
         </p>
         <p>- Unity can act as both a client and a server. See the Custom GameLift section below.</p>

         <p><strong>Game Session</strong> represents an active game where we group players together
            for a multiplayer game. We can configure how many players are allowed to play and how
            long the game should last. Players will join an active game session to play the game.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Player Session</strong> represents an active player participating in a
            multiplayer Game Session.

         <h1 class="display-1 mt-6">Server types</h1>
         <p>GameLift comes in two flavors: RealTime and Custom</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12">
         <h2 class="mt-4">RealTime GameLift</h2>
         <p class="mb-5">RealTime servers is the lightweight approach to GameLift. This is not the
            option for
            hosting your Unity backend server build, use the Custom GameLift approach instead. AWS
            provides a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/realtime-script.html"
               target="_blank">basic
               Javascript template</a> that has all the lifecycle code needed to kickoff
            the RealTime server. It allows you to easily manage game and player sessions.
            Basically, it provides a relay for your game clients to send and receive messages. You
            probably won’t be using this option for a fast paced first person shooter or MMO, but
            maybe for a small turn based game where you need to track turns and scores.<br />

         <h2 class="mt-5">Custom GameLift</h2>
         <p class="mb-5">Custom GameLift servers is the option where you want to run a Unity
            project (or server
            build) as your backend server. They also support Unreal and Lumberyard, but I will be
            referencing Unity for my tutorials as the concepts are relatively the same. There are a
            couple things you have to setup in your project for it to be able to communicate with
            the GameLift internal services, but I cover all of that in the videos below. The
            biggest difference between RealTime and Custom is for custom you have to setup your own
            communication server. I cover this in Part 3 below.<br />

         <h1 class="display-1 mt-6">Alternative AWS Services</h1>
         <h2 class="">For game servers (Lambda, EC2, & Lightsail)</h2>
         <p>
            If you’d prefer to not use GameLift, you can leverage other AWS services like Lambda,
            EC2, or Lightsail as your backend services. You’d have to manage everything on your own
            including matchmaking, game/player session management, auto-scaling, server security,
            etc.
         </p>
         <p>Lambda is a possible alternative for simple games that don’t require a ton of
            processing power or complexity. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOtt3_R1rR9XDEiCvX3BWP0DKm_kpZwEV"
               target="_blank">I’ve actually created a video series on this topic with an example
               implementation</a>. EC2 and Lightsail services will allow you to deploy basically
            anything that runs on Linux/Unix or Windows, so as they differ in cost and
            configuration complexity, they will probably work for whatever tech stack you’re
            comfortable with.
         </p>
         <p>
            It’s important to think about where your project is currently at and where you see it
            going over the next several weeks or months. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/pricing/"
               target="_blank">You get 125 hours of free GameLift per month</a>, but that only
            lasts for the first year. If your game backend can run on Lambda, for example, and
            you’re comfortable with the pricing of the other services you’ll be using (Cognito,
            Dynamodb, S3, etc…), maybe stick with that. Maybe you don’t care about scaling, match
            making, or session management. My point is, just because GameLift is all inclusive and
            has “game” in its service name, doesn’t mean you have to use it. AWS offers numerous
            services that all work together, so go with what works best for you.
